USAGE:
python main.py type max_pass
where type (required) specifies which kind of perceptron to run, and max_pass is optional (default is 500)

Type options:
1 - Exercise 1.1: Binary perceptron on spambase dataset
2 - Exercise 1.2: Multiclass perceptron using one-vs-rest reduction, on activity dataset
3 - Exercise 1.3: Multiclass perceptron using one-vs-one reduction, on activity dataset
4 - Exercise 1.3: Direct multiclass perceptron on activity dataset

* Uses pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries.
* Implemented and tested using python 3.10
* all exercises should finish in under 2 minutes for default passes
